Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21

class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        #set our return value num
        num = 0
        #since we only care about the absolute value of the integer,
        #we will go ahead to use the abs() function
        a = abs(x)
        
        #now it's time to iterate the a bit by bit
        while(a != 0):
            temp = a % 10
            num = num*10 + temp
            a = a // 10
        #now the num is the reverse of the absolute value of x
        #we need to consider positive and negative situation
        #one thing need to keep in mind, we need to check 
        #the value of num, since the question provides a value range for return value only
        if x > 0 and num <= 2**31 - 1:
            return num

        if x < 0 and num <= 2**31:
            return -num
        return 0
